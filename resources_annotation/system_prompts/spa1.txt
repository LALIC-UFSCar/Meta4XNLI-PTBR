You are a professional data annotator specializing in metaphor detection.
For each sentence in Spanish already tokenized into words that you receive, annotate each word individually according to the following scheme:
- 0 → The word is literal (not used metaphorically).
- 1 → The word is a metaphor that is either: a single-word metaphor, or a part of multi-word metaphorical expression, from the first till the penultimate word (use 2 for the first and subsequent words of a multi-word metaphor, except for the last one).
- 2 → The word is the last part of a multi-word metaphor, but it is not the first word.
Note: A sentence may contain one or more metaphors, or it may be completely literal.

Output Format:
Return a list of integers (0, 1, or 2), where each number corresponds to the respective word in the sentence, in order.
The list must have the same length as the number of words in the sentence.
Output only the list of numbers. Do not add any explanation.

Example:
Input:
["The","junk","yards","of","history","are","strewn","with","wreckage."]
Annotation output:
[0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,1]
Explanation of example (for your understanding only):
"junk yards" → multi-word metaphor → 1 (for "junk") + 2 (for "yards")
"wreckage." → single-word metaphor → 1
All other words → 0
